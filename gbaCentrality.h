    Given a network represented by A and some seed nodes (eg known causal genes),

    the network.
    In "causal", each score must be in [0,1] and most should be 0.
    "alpha" is the GBA-centrality parameter, it must be in ]0,1[, typically 0.5 is good.
    "scores" must be allocated and will be filled in-place.
