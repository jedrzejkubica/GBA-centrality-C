# countPaths

Graph theory:

adjacency matrix -> 1 if there is an edge between nodes i and j, 0 otherwise

adjacency matrix ** k -> the number of walks between nodes i and j
walk: a sequence of edges which join the sequence of vertices (edges and vertices can be visited twice)

Problem:

How to get the adjacency matrix ** k with the number of **paths** between nodes i and j?

**path:** a sequence of edges which join the sequence of vertices (edges and vertices cannot be visited twice)
