    this module defines the compact representation of an adjacency matrix
*/

/*
    compactAdjacencyMatrix represents an adjacency matrix of size nbNodes x nbNodes;

    offsets has nbNodes+1 elements,
    offsets[j] is the first index corresponding to node j in predecessors and weights,
    offsets[nbNodes] is the sum of degrees, used to avoid overflowing;

    nodes with an edge going into node j are nodes predecessors[offsets[j]]
    up to predecessors[offsets[j+1]-1];

    the corresponding edge weights (coming into node j) are weights[offsets[j]]
    up to weights[offsets[j+1]-1]

    offsetsReverseEdge has sumOfDegrees elements (same as predecessors and weights),
    for any i < sumOfDegrees offsetsReverseEdge[i] is the offset corresponding to 
    edge j->p (assuming i is the offset of edge p->j) if j->p exists, sumOfDegrees
    otherwise

    We must use size_t for offsets, since one signalWithpredMatrix can have
    more elements than UINT_MAX. Actually we will use size_t everywhere, the
    predecessors is not large anyways.
